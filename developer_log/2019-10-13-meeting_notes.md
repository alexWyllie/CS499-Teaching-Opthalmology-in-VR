# Meeting Notes Oct. 13th 2019

Attendance: Everyone Present

## Agenda

- Get familiar with making and working with 3D objects in Unity.

## Progress

- It turns out making assets in Unity is hard, found it easier to make them in blender then export
- Fumbled for quite a while until finding an appropriate tutorial for creating the desired object and texturing it
- Found there were issues with exporting the object with the texture baked on, to be fixed later
- Were able to get a good looking object textured which is promising for future work
- Found blender can have automated scripts built for it, indicating a texturing server could be hacked together if task deemed worthy of automation
- Video of current progress sent to customers to get approval and buy in

## Next steps

- Need to streamline the texturing process and become experts at how to do it, either automated or document how to do manually
- Need to fix issue related to exporting object for use in Unity game engine
- Work on architecture assignment takes precidence over software development at the moment
